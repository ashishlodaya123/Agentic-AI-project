    "content": "For patients presenting with acute respiratory distress, immediate assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) is critical. Administer high-flow oxygen via non-rebreather mask initially. Obtain arterial blood gas analysis, complete blood count, and inflammatory markers. Perform chest X-ray and consider CT pulmonary angiography if pulmonary embolism is suspected. Administer bronchodilators for suspected bronchospasm. Consider non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP/CPAP) for cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Escalate to mechanical ventilation if hypoxemia persists despite maximal oxygen therapy. Monitor for development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with persistent hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates. Consider prone positioning for severe ARDS. Initiate lung-protective ventilation strategies with low tidal volumes (6 mL/kg predicted body weight) and plateau pressures <30 cmH2O. Implement conservative fluid management after initial resuscitation. Consider corticosteroids in refractory cases. Monitor for ventilator-associated complications including pneumonia and barotrauma.",

Monitor for end-organ damage including encephalopathy, myocardial ischemia, acute kidney injury, and aortic dissection. Hypertensive urgency can be managed with oral antihypertensives with follow-up in 24-48 hours. Avoid rapid blood pressure reduction which can cause organ hypoperfusion. For aortic dissection, target systolic blood pressure 100-120 mmHg with beta-blockade first. For acute stroke, avoid aggressive BP lowering unless >220/120 mmHg.
